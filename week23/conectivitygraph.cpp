/**
 * Home work Week 2 & Week 3
 * Basic requirement:
 *
 *  - Write a set of constructors for declaring and initializing a graph.
 *
 *  - An edge will have a positive cost that is its distance.
 *
 *  - Have a procedure that produces a randomly generated set of edges with
 *    positive distances. Assume the graphs are undirected.
 *
 *  - The random graph procedure should have edge density as a parameter and
 *    distance range as a parameter. So a graph whose density is 0.1 would have
 *    10% of its edges picked at random and its edge distance would be selected
 *    at random from the distance range.
 *
 *  - The procedure should run through all possible undirected edges, say (i,j)
 *    and place the edge in the graph if a random probability calculation is
 *    less than the density.
 *
 *  - Compute for a set of randomly generated graphs an average shortest path.
 *
 *
 * Turn in:
 *  - Printout of program, 200 words on what you learned, and output
 *    showing the average path length calculation. Use densities: 20% and 40% on
 *    a graph of 50 nodes with a distance range of 1.0 to 10.0. To get an
 *    average path length, compute the 49 paths:
 *                         1 to 2, 1 to 3, 1 to 4, â€¦, 1 to 50.
 *    [In an instance where there is no path between 1 and n, omit that value
 *    from the average. This should be very rare for the chosen density and size
 *    in this homework.]

/**
 * What I've learned.
 *
 * I have learned that chooing a correct data structure can be essentially
 * important in solving the problem. For example, I was trying to use vector to
 * store the open and close set, but it turns out they are not good enough for
 * this purpose, as we need to insert and delete a node very often(as in
 * openset). Such operations on an vector is not efficient and can be hard to
 * write.
 *
 * I was thinking to use unordered_map and unordered_set to store both openset
 * and closeset. But I need to define custome hash function to be able to use it
 * as I am using std::pair to store start and end node. So I eventually choosed
 * std::set and std::map which has slight slow performance in search O(logN) but
 * relative easy to implement and relative fast in inserting and deleting nodes.
